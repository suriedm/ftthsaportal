In the event that the product or service you have applied for is not activated within 30 (thirty) days of the Acceptance Date (or such extended period as GPS may advise) due to an Uncontrollable Event, the Agreement will automatically terminate, and no party shall have any liability to the other as a result of such termination.</p>

  <p>2.3 Save as specifically provided for in clause 2.2 above, termination of the Agreement shall be governed by and given effect to as contemplated in the Agreement. In particular, month-to-month agreements (other than fixed term agreements contemplated in clause 2.2.1 and clause 2.2.2) may be terminated by either GPS or you on 1 (one) calendar months’ notice, save to the extent provided otherwise in the Product Terms, which termination will take effect on the first day of the month immediately following the end of the applicable notice period.</p>

  <li><strong>NCA and ECT Act</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>3.1 Although the Agreement is not a credit agreement as contemplated in the NCA, your application for a service or product may be subject to a credit referencing or risk assessment process. This means that GPS may utilize the information provided by you including your personal information and request and receive information about you and your credit record (“<strong>Assessment Information</strong>”) from registered credit bureaus in order to determine whether you will be in a position to meet your obligations under the intended Agreement.

  <p>4.4 To the fullest extent permitted by law, all amounts due and payable in terms of the Agreement shall be paid free of exchange and without deduction or set-off, by way of a direct debit order in favour of GPS (drawn against an existing banking account nominated by you), or in such other manner as GPS may from time to time determine.</p>
  <p>4.5 You agree that GPS will be entitled and authorized to draw all amounts payable in terms of the Agreement from the account specified by you (or any other bank or branch to which it may be transferred).</p>
  <p>4.6 Unless otherwise agreed in the Application Form or Product Terms the debit order authorization will, subject to clause 8.2 above, in terms of the default billing procedure, commence on the Activation Date and will continue and not be revoked until termination of the Agreement or until all amounts due and owing to GPS have been fully and finally discharged; and</p>
  <p>4.6.1 will in the first instance be collected immediately or run within 5 (five) Business Days of Activation and immediately collect:</p>
  <p>4.6.1.1 any pro rata subscription charges due in advance for the current month; and</p>
  <p>4.6.1.2 any subscription charges due in advance for the following month if Activation occurs on or after the 26th of a month; and</p>
  <p>4.6.1.3 any outstanding setup and/or hardware charges (whether delivered or to be delivered) or the like; and</p>
  <p>4.6.2 will thereafter be collected on the last working day of the first month (if Activation occurred before the 26th of a month), or on the last working day of the following month (if Activation occurred on or after the 26th of a month) and each subsequent month, to collect any amounts due, such as the next month’s subscription charges and/or any applicable usage charges, and/or hardware charges (whether delivered or to be delivered) or the like, whatever may be due and payable on the last working day of each subsequent month.</p>
  <p>4.7 You agree to sign all such forms and do all such things as may be necessary to give effect to the debit order as contemplated in clause 8.6 above or otherwise.</p>
  <p>4.8 Depending on the Activation Date your first bill may thus be for part of a month and you may be charged for the number of days left in the month or the full month (depending on the product or Product Terms e.g. software license fees normally not pro-rated) in which you signed up or switched over, plus the subscription for the next month and any once off charges that may be applicable.</p>
  <p>4.9 Should you fail to pay any amount on the due date for payment then GPS may, without prejudice to any of its other rights and remedies:</p>
  <p>4.9.1 take all such further steps as may be necessary to recover the outstanding amount from you, including without limitation the use of debt collection mechanisms.</p>
  <p>4.9.2 suspend your access to the service or the use of any product without notice to you until such time as the outstanding amount has been paid in full; or</p>
  <p>4.9.3 subject to clause 2, terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.</p>
  <p>4.10 In the event of GPS suspending your access to the service, GPS reserves the right to continue to charge you the minimum required to keep your account activated for the period of suspension, unless terminated by you in terms of the Agreement.</p>
  <p>4.11 If any changes are proposed to any terms of an agreement between GPS and a Network Operator and/or any third party supplier, which impacts on the provision of any services or products in terms of the Agreement, or if any changes to this Agreement are necessary because of new and/or amended legislation and/or changes to GPS’s license conditions and/or any changes to our products and services and/or fees and charges relating thereto, GPS shall subject to clause 2 above, be entitled to amend the terms, fees or charges for its services or products at any time on 30 (thirty) days’ notice to you as provided for in clause 21 below. However, should the Network Operator and/or third party supplier not provide GPS with timeous written notice, or should any other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of GPS occurs which does not enable GPS to reasonably have the opportunity to give 30 (thirty) days’ notice, then GPS will only be able to provide written notice to you within a reasonable period after GPS is so notified, and in such event the notice period may be shorter than the aforesaid 30 (thirty) day notice period. The amendment will take effect on the date indicated in the notice.</p>
  <p>4.12 GPS will use reasonable endeavors to inform you well in advance, and in any event prior to disconnection, about the possibility of disconnection in the case of non-payment.</p>

  <p>4.14 To the extent that GPS incurs any additional expenditure relating to the tracing and/or collection of unpaid amounts, those costs shall be for your account to the extent permitted by law.</p>
  <p>4.15 Where you select any item to be added to your bill in the My Account site, the cost of such item will appear on your next bill.</p>
